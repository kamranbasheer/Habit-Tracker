# Habit-Tracker
This is a web application based on flask framework. Development is still in progress.
To run it, please clone the repo in your desired IDE and run python run.py to run it on localhost

Why have i created this webapp?

I got the inspiration from the book "ATOMIC HABITS" which made me realize how important it is to keep track of your habits and make yourself consistent, because you can never learn anything or achieve anything if you don't do something consistently.
I hope this webapp helps me and others to become consistent and achieve thier goals.
