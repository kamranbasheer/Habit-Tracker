# Habit-Tracker
This is a web application based on flask framework. Development is still in progress.
Your progress will be saved in the database.
I have made it very simple to run it directly on the machine without a need of any setup. Just follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo in your desired IDE
2. Install python if not installed yet.
3. run the command in the terminal "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. then run the command "python run.py" and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on the browser. That's it!

Why have i created this webapp?

I got the inspiration from the book "ATOMIC HABITS" which made me realize how important it is to keep track of your habits and make yourself consistent, because you can never learn anything or achieve anything if you don't do something consistently.
I hope this webapp helps me and others to become consistent and achieve thier goals.
